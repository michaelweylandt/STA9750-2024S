# The Story of My Life. 

Hi! This document has some information about me. 

## About Me

I have taken the following classes: 







I would also like to tell you about my projects: basket weaving, stock market investing, 
and robot wrestling. 


## Code Block Demo

```{r}
library(nycflights13) # Has the flights data
library(dplyr) # Sql type functionality

glimpse(flights)
```

Let's find the ten flights arrived the most ahead of schedule

```{r}
flights %>%
    arrange(arr_delay) %>%
    slice_head(n=10) ## Roughly equivalent to LIMIT 10
```


The flights data has XXX flights.
