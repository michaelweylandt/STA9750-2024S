  This week, we begin to study the world of text data. While numerical data is 
  reasonably straight-forward to deal with, text data is remarkably complex. A 
  full discussion of text data requires understanding the vast world of human written
  language, but we will discuss enough of the major points to hopefully solve 95% 
  of the challenges you will face in your career.

## Goals

In our quest to understand text data, we have two major goals:

- Understanding String Encodings and Unicode
- Manipulating Strings with Regular Expressions

Before we get into these, let's begin with a basic review of the _character_ data
type in _R_. 

## String Vectors

Recall that _R_ works by default on _vectors_ - ordered collections of the "same sort" 
of thing. _R_ supports the following vector types:

- **Raw** for pure access to bytes without any additional meaning: rarely useful
  for pure data-analytic work
- **Integer**: 32-bit signed integers, ranging from $-2^{30}$ to $2^{30}-1$. (If you
  have done low-level work before, you might ask where the extra bit went: it's used
  for encoding _NA_ values.)
- **Numeric**: 64-bit (double precision) floating point values, ranging from (approximately)
  $\pm 10^{308}$. The detailed behavior of numeric (often called double) data is beyond
  this course, but it is well documented elsewhwere.
- **Character**: the topic of today's discussion. 

*R* makes no difference between a *character* - in the sense of a single letter -
and a *string*: in particular, each *element* of a *character vector* is an 
(arbitrary length) string. Specialized functions are required for work at the
true "single letter" scale. If you come from other languages, this behavior might
be surprising, but it allows *R* to handle much of the complexity associated with 
characters automagically, which greatly simplifies data analysis.

When speaking, we refer to *R* as using _strings_, even if *R* itself calls them
character elements for historical reasons.

## Encoding

How are strings represented on a computer? The answer has evolved over time, but
the current state of the art - used by almost all non-legacy software - is based
on the *Unicode system* and the *UTF-8* encoding. 

The *Unicode system* is comprised of two essential parts: 
- A numbered list of "letter-like" elements
- Rules for manipulating those elements

While this seems simple, it is anything but. The history of string representations
in computers is a long and painful story of programmers repeatedly underestimating
the complexity of the seemingly simple task of listing "all the letters." 

The Unicode consortium makes a long list of characters that computers should be able
to represent: the most recent version of the Unicode standard includes 149,813 characters
divided into 161 scripts. These include everything from the basic (Anglo-American)
Latin alphabet to the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets to Chinese and Japanese characters
to the undeciphered Linear A alphabet and Tengwar, the fictional script used in the
Lord of the Rings novels. The Unicode standard also includes a wide set of Emoji
(approximately 4000) and many "modifying" characters. 

To each of these, the Unicode consortium assigns a _code point_ : a numerical identifier. 
Even superficially similar characters may be assigned different code points to distinguish them: 
for example, "H" is code point U+0048 with the official description "Latin Capital Letter H"
while "Η" is U+0397, "Greek Capital Letter Eta." 

The difference between these characters is essential to know how to manipulate them: 

```{r}
x <- "H"
y <- "Η"
```

Use the `tolower` function to lower-case each of these:

```{r e1_Hlatin, exercise=TRUE}
x <- "H"
y <- "Η"
tolower(x)
```


```{r e1_Hgreek, exercise=TRUE}
x <- "H"
y <- "Η"
tolower(y)
```

The Unicode standard defines the lower case mapping of U+0048 as the Latin lower case
h, while the lower case mapping of U+0397 as the Greek lower case eta, which looks
something like a _streched_ n. 

In general, these mappings are _incredibly_ complicated and depend not only on the 
specific code point, but also the set of translation rules being used. (Certain languages
have different lower/upper mappings for what are otherwise the same letter.)

While you don't need to know all of this complexity, it is essential to know that 
it's out there and to rely on battle-tested libraries to perform these mappings. 

Unicode is supplemented by the `UTF-8` encodings, which controls how 0/1-bit strings
are actually translated to code points. (Fonts then map code points to what you see
on the screen.) UTF-8 is more-or-less back-compatible with other major encodings, 
so it's a good default. When dealing with modern websites or public data sources, they
almost always present their contents in a `UTF-8` compatible encoding (if not `UTF-8` proper)
so you should be ok. 

A well-formatted website will state its encoding near the top of the page: 

```{r}
library(rvest)
read_html("https://baruch.cuny.edu") |>
    html_elements("meta[charset]") |>
    html_attr("charset")
```

**Advice**: Whenever possible, make sure you are using *UTF-8* strings: if your data
is not *UTF-8*, reencode it to *UTF-8* as soon as possible. This will save you much
pain. 

## String Manipulation

Once data is in _R_ and encoded as UTF-8 Unicode points, we have several tools
for dealing with strings. Your first port of call should be the [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) 
package. 

All the functions of the `stringr` package start with `str_` and take a vector
of strings as the first argument, making them well suited for chained analysis. 

Let's start with `str_length` which simply computes the length of each element. 
For the basic Latin alphabet, this more or less matches our intuition: 

```{r}
x <- c("I", "am", "a", "student", "at", "Baruch.")
str_length(x)
```

but it can be tricky for strings that involve unicode _combining characters_. 

```{r}
str_length("X̅")
```

Here the "overbar" is a combining character which we add on to the `X`. This is
commonly (though not always) used for languages with accents (*e.g.* French) or for
languages where vowels are written above and below the main script (Arabic or Hebrew). 
This same idea is used for certain Emoji constructs: 

```{r}
str_length("👨🏿")
```

Here, "Man with Dark Skin Tone" is the combination of "Man" and "Dark Skin Tone."
(Compare how this appears in the rendered document to how RStudio prints it.)

While there is complexity in all of Unicode, `str_length` will behave as you might 
expect for "regular" text. I'm going to stop showing the "scary case" of Unicode, 
but you should be aware of it for the remainder of these exercises.

### Concatenation

You have already seen the base `paste` and `paste0` functions for combining
two string vectors together. 

```{r}
x <- c("Michael", "Mary", "Gus")
y <- c("Son", "Daughter", "Dog")

paste(x, y)
```

By default, `paste` combines strings with a space between them, while `paste0` omits
the space. `paste` is typically what you want for strings for human reading, while `paste0`
is a better guess for computer-oriented text (*e.g.*, putting together a URL).

You can change the separator by passing a `sep` argument to paste:

```{r}
paste(x, y, sep = " is my ")
```

You can also combine together multiple elements of a vector using the `collapse`
argument:

```{r}
paste(x, collapse = " and ")
```

#### Exercises:

Using the `paste` function, make a vector of strings like "John's favorite color is blue":

```{r ex_paste1, exercise=TRUE}
people <- c("John", "Jane", "Randy", "Tammi")
colors <- c("blue", "orange", "grey", "chartreuse")
```

Modify your answer to write a (run-on) sentence of favorite colors: "John's favorite color is blue and Jane's favorite color is orange and ..."

```{r ex_paste2,exercise=TRUE}
people <- c("John", "Jane", "Randy", "Tammi")
colors <- c("blue", "orange", "grey", "chartreuse")
```


### Substring Selection

When cleaning up data for analysis, it is common to need to take _substrings_ from larger text.
The `str_sub` function will do this: 

```{r}
x <- c("How", "much", "is", "that", "puppy", "in", "the", "window?")
str_sub(x, 1, 2)
```

If you want to go all the way to the end, set the end element to `-1`: 

```{r}
str_sub(x, 2, -1)
```

#### Exercises

Using `str_sub`, remove the system name (CUNY or UC) and return only the campus name:

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE}
library(stringr)
uc_schools <- c("UC Berkeley", "UC San Diego", "UC Santa Cruz", "UC Davis")
cuny_schools <- c("Baruch College, CUNY", "City College, CUNY", "La Guardia Community College, CUNY")
str_sub(uc_schools)
```

### Detect and Matching

Often we only need to know whether a particular substring is present in a larger string. 
We can use `str_detect` to do this: 

```{r}
library(stringr)
dogs <- c("basset hound", "greyhound", "labrador retreiver", "border collie", "Afgahn hound")
str_detect(dogs, "hound")
```

The `str_match` function will return the *text* of the match. Here it's useless, but we'll 
see that it becomes more powerful when we allow more flexible pattern specifications.

```{r}
library(stringr)
dogs <- c("basset hound", "greyhound", "labrador retreiver", "border collie", "Afgahn hound")
str_match(dogs, "hound")
```

#### Exercises

Use `str_detect` to find the CUNY schools:

```{r ex_detect, exercise=TRUE}
library(stringr)
schools <- c("UC Davis", 
             "UC Santa Cruz", 
             "City College, CUNY", 
             "UC Berkeley", 
             "La Guardia Community College, CUNY", 
             "Baruch College, CUNY", 
             "UC San Diego")
str_sub(uc_schools)
```

### Specifying Patterns

While working by individual characters is sometimes useful (for very regular data), we
generally need more powerful tools: _regular expressions_ (RE) provide a compact language
for specifying patterns in strings. We'll introduce the basics here to help with 
string functions and then explore some more advanced RE features. 

The most basic pattern is a set of elements in brackets: this means "any of these". 

For example, we want to see which names have an "A" in them: 

```{r}
names <- c("Jane", "Rhonda", "Reggie", "Bernie", "Walter", "Arthur")
str_detect(names, "a") ## Wrong!
str_detect(names, "A") ## Wrong!
str_detect(names, "[Aa]") ## Right!
```

Alternatively, we can see which strings contain numbers: 
```{r}
x <- c("73 cows", "47 chickens", "a dozen eggs")
str_detect(x, "[0123456789]")
```

If we use `str_match` we can pull out the matching element: 

```{r}
x <- c("2 burgers", "3 soups", "5 fish")
str_match(x, "[0123456789]")
```

By default, this only finds _one_ appearance of the pattern: 

```{r}
x <- c("23 burgers", "34 soups", "56 fish")

# Why is this wrong?
str_match(x, "[0123456789]")
```


We can modify the pattern specifier to include count information. The basic behavior
is to add explicit count bounds:

```{r}
x <- c("2 burgers", "34 soups", "567 fish")
str_match(x, "[0123456789]{2}")
str_match(x, "[0123456789]{3}")
str_match(x, "[0123456789]{2,3}")
str_match(x, "[0123456789]{2,}")
```

Here a single number is an exact count (`{2}`), while pairs (`{2,3}`) specify a range. 
If one end of the range is left empty, it is 0 or infinite (depending on the direction). 

Certain count specifications are sufficiently useful to get their own syntax:

- One or more: `+` is equivalent to `{1,}`
- Zero or more: `*` is equivalent to `{0,}` 
- One or zero: `?` is equivalent to `{0,1}`.

Use these specifications for the next set of exercises.

#### Exercises

Which strings contain a three digit number? 
```{r ex_quant, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("2 burgers", "34 soups", "567 fish")
str_detect(x, )
```

Which strings contain 

### Combining patterns

You can combine REs to make more complex patterns: 

- `(a|b)` means `a` or `b`. This is like `[]` notation but `a`, `b` can be more complex
  than single characters
```{r}
x <- c("Baruch College, CUNY", "UC Berkeley", "Harvard University")
str_detect(x, "(CUNY|UC)")
```

- `[^abc]` means _anything other than_ `a`, `b`, `c`. You can often achieve a similar
  effect using the `negate` argument to `str_detect`, but you need this specifically for 
  `str_match`

```{r}
x <- c("10 blue fish", "three wet goats", "15 otters in hats")
str_detect(x, "[^0123456789]")
```

- `^` outside of a bracket denotes the start of a line: 
```{r}
x <- c("rum", "white rum", "flavored rum")
str_detect(x, "^rum")
```

- `$` denotes the end of a line: 
```{r}
x <- c("bourbon whiskey", "scotch whisky", "whiskey liqueurs")
str_detect(x, "whisk[e]?y$")
```

See [the stringr RE docs](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html) for
more examples of regular expressions. 

#### Exercises

1. Use a regular expression to find which of these are fish species:

```{r ex1_sum, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("clownfish", "goldfish", "fish food")
str_detect(x, )
```

2. Use a regular expression to find words with three or more vowels in a row:

```{r ex2_sum, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("haaar", "xjjejeje", "youins", "exigent")
str_detect(x, )
```

3. Find the words where "q" is not followed by a "u"

```{r, ex3_sum, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("queen", "quiet", "qipao", "coq au vin")
str_detect(x, )
```

### Replacement

The `str_replace` function allows us to replace a string with something else. 
This is particularly useful when cleaning up text: 
```{r}
x <- c("Manhattan, NY", "Bronx, New York", "Brooklyn, ny", "Queens, nY")
str_replace(x, "([nN][yY]|New York)", "NY")
```
