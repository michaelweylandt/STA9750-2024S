# Welcome

This tutorial will walk you through setting up R on your computer, installing
and loading *packages*, loading data sets, and manipulating those datasets using 
the `dplyr` package.

## Install and Set-Up

The first part of this tutorial will help you set up your computer to use R. 
It is for you if you need to:

* Install R on your computer
* Install the RStudio IDE
* Install the `tidyverse` R package

You can skip this part of the tutorial if you've already done these things.

### Is this section for you?

Do you need to work through the install tutorial? Take the quiz below to find out.


```{r quiz1, echo = FALSE}
question("Check all that you have NOT done:",
  answer("installed R on my computer", message = "* Install R"),
  answer("installed the RStudio IDE", message = "* Install RStudio IDE"),
  answer("installed the tidyverse R package", message = "* Install Packages"),
  answer("None of the above. I've done them all.", correct = TRUE, message = "You can skip this tutorial! Click 'Basic Operations in R' on the left hand side to skip ahead."),

### Install RStudio

#### How to install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R. What does that mean? Well, if you think of R as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and I suggest that you use it!

## Basic Operations in R

In this section, we will review some of the basic 'built-in' features of `R`. 
In the next section (`Packages`) we will discuss how to add to the "base-bones"
functionality. 

When working with `R`, there are two interacting 'subsystems' in play:

- The `R` language and interpreter: this is the part of `R` that is similar
  to `python` or `C`/`C++`. You will write `R` code in the `R` language and the
  `R` interpreter will run that code. The fact that all of these elements are
  called `R` is a bit confusing, but once you get the hang of things, the distinctions
  will melt away.
- `R` packages: When working in `R`, you do not have to start from scratch every
  time. Other programmers make `sets` of code available to you in the form of
  `packages`. For our purposes, a package can contain two things:
  - Pre-written functions to help you achieve some goal
  - Data sets
  Most of the time, the primary purpose of a package is sharing functions and code: 
  there are easier ways to share data with the world.
  

```{r lang_v_lib, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - The R Language",
  question("What is R?",
    answer("A statistical computing environment consisting of both a programming language and a set of libraries full of statistical functionality", correct=TRUE, message="Indeed! R is both of these things. It also comes with a set of numerical libraries and a graphics engine we will learn more about in a later lecture."),
    answer("`A programming language`", message="R is indeed a Turing-complete programming language (i.e., one which can do ~anything) but it also comes with built-in functionality"),
    answer("A set of libraries", message="R comes with a rich set of libraries (and makes it easy to install more!) but you also need the R Interpreter to actually use those libraries."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

When you first downloaded `R`, you downloaded the interpreter and a set of base 
packages written by the "R Core Development Team". 

Run the following code to see what your `R` environment looks like:
```{r sessioninfo, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
  
```{r sessioninfo_q, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Session Info",
  question("What version of R are you running?",
    answer(R.version$version.string, correct=TRUE),
    answer("3.12.1"),
    answer("1.0"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ), 
  question("What operating system are you on?", 
           answer("Linux", correct = R.version$os == "linux-gnu"), 
           answer("Mac", correct = stringr::str_count(R.version$os, "darwin")),
           answer("Windows", correct = stringr::str_count(R.version$os, "windows")),
           allow_retry=TRUE), 
  question("Which of these is a base package?", 
           answer("stats", correct=TRUE), 
           answer("ggplot2"),
           answer("LAPACK")
           )
)
```


When asking for help, always include the output of the `sessionInfo()` command
so that your helper can quickly know how your system is set-up.

### Variables & Assignment

Whenever you type a "word" of `R` code, it must be one of three things:
- A reserved word: this is a small set of `keywords` that `R` keeps for its own use. 
  These have special rules for their use that we'll learn as we go along. The main
  ones are: `if`, `else`, `for`, `in`, `while`, `function`, `repeat`, `break`, and `next`. 
  
  If you use one of these words and get a weird error message, it's because you aren't 
  respecting the special rules for these words.
  
  For the nitty gritty, see the `Reserved` help page but feel free to skip this for now.
  The `Control` help page gives additional details. 
  
  (When you run a help page in this tutorial, it looks a bit funny. 
   Try running `?Reserved` directly in `RStudio` for better formatting.)
- A "literal". This is a word that represents "just the thing" without any additional
  indirection. The most common types of literals are: 
  - Numeric: *e.g.*, `3`, `42.0`, or `1e-3`
  - String: *e.g.*, `'a'`, `"beach"`, or `'cream soda'`
  There are a few rules for literals, but the most important is that strings
  begin and end with the same character, either a single quote or a double quote. 
  When `R` sees a single quote, it will read _everything_ until the next single
  quote as one string, even if there's a double quote inside.

  Try some literals:
```{r ex_literals, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
42
"a"
"3 + 4"
'if I go to 4 beaches, I will shout "hurray!"'
```  
  What does the literal `0xF` represent? (You don't need to worry about why. This
  is a fancier literal than we will use in this class.)
- A "variable name". This is the most common sort of "word" in code. It is used
  to _something_ without actually having to know what it is. 

  We can create variables using the "assignment" operator: `<-`
```{r ex_assignment, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 3
x
```  
  When you read this outloud, read `<-` as "gets" so `x <- 3` becomes
  "x gets 3."

  When we use the assignment operator on a variable, 
  it overwrites the value of a variable silently and without warning
```{r ex_assignment2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 3
x
x <- 5
x
```  
  We also put expressions on the right hand side of an assignment: 
```{r ex_assignment3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 1 + 2
x
y <- sin(pi / 2) ## Radians!
y 
```  
  Also note the trick we've used here a few times: a "plain" line of code
  without an assignment generally prints its value.
  
```{r literals_q, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Literals and Basic Syntax",
  question("In the code snippet `x <- 3`, what is `3`?",
    answer("A numeric literal", correct=TRUE),
    answer("A variable"),
    answer("An expression"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ), 
  question("If I run the command `x <- 3` and then later run `x <- 'a'`, what is the value of `x`?", 
           answer("3"), 
           answer("3, a"), 
           answer("The string 'a'", correct=TRUE, message="If you're coming from other languages, you might wonder
                  why I'm not saying character here. R makes no distinction between characters and strings."),
           allow_retry=TRUE), 
  question("Which of these is _not_ a reserved word?", 
           answer("class", correct=TRUE), 
           answer("if"),
           answer("while")
           )
)
```

### Data Structures

To do anything beyond basic calculator math in `R`, we will need to make use
of `R`'s built-in _data structures_. (A _data structure_ is just a systematic way
to organize some related data.)

If you've programmed in `python` before, you've seen the basic data structures
of `list`, `set`, and `dict` as well as possibly created your own. `R`'s built-in
data structures are a bit different. 

#### Vectors

A _vector_ is a ordered array of the same _sort_ of thing (*e.g.*, all numbers or all strings). 
We can create vectors using the `c` command (short for concatenate). 
```{r ex_vec1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
y <- c("a", "b", "c")
y
```  
Change the above example to `c(1, "a", 3)` and examine the output. What happened?

To see the _type_ (sort) of a vector, you can use the `str` command. 
```{r ex_vec2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
str(x)
```  
`str(x)` tells us about the _structure_ of `x`. Here, we see that `x` is a _numeric_
vector of length 3. 

`R` will try to do the right thing when doing arithmetic on vectors.
```{r ex_vec3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x + 5
```  

```{r ex_vec4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
x + y
```

When you give `R` vectors of different lenghts, it will "recycle" the shorter one
to the length of the longer one. 
```{r ex_vec5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(10, 20)
x + y
```

This can be a double-edge sword when the two vectors don't fit together so nicely:
```{r ex_vec6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5)
x + y
```
How was the last element of `x+y` computed? 

Here we see also that `R` printed a _warning_ message. A _warning_ message is `R`'s
way of saying "something is funny, but I can still do this" while it (successfully)
implements your command. It's here to help you, but sometimes can be safely ignored
if you're sure about what you're doing.

An _error_ is a "I can't do this" message. When `R` encounters an `error` 
it stops and does not fully execute the command
```{r ex_vec7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c("a", "b", "c")
x * y
```
Here we get an error because there is no meaningful way to multiply a string 
by a number, unlike earlier where the recycling rule told `R` what to do, even if it was
probably a bad idea.


```{r vectors_q, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Vectors",
  question("What is the type (or class) of the vector `c(1,2,3)`",
    answer("Numeric", correct=TRUE),
    answer("String"),
    answer("Boolean"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ), 
  question("What is the type (or class) of the vector `c('a','b','c')`",
    answer("Numeric"),
    answer("String", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Boolean"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ), 
  question("What is the value of `c(1,2,3) * c(3, 2, 1)`", 
           answer("c(3, 3, 3)"), 
           answer("3"), 
           answer("c(3, 4)"),
           answer("(c(3, 4, 3)", correct=TRUE),
           allow_retry=TRUE), 
  question("When I do arithmetic on vectors of different lengths, what does R do?", 
           answer("Recycle the shorter vector to the longer and throw an error if the shorter vector does not evenly divide the longer vector"),
           answer("Recycle the shorter vector to the longer and print a warning if the shorter vector does not evenly divide the longer vector", correct=TRUE),
           answer("Truncate the longer vector to fit the shorter one"),
           answer("Recycle the shorter vector to fit the longer one")
           )
)
```

In brief, `R` vectors are like `SQL` columns: sets of the same sort of thing.
As we will see later, there's also a notion of a `NULL` which `R` calls an `NA` (not available).
Unlike `SQL`, `R` vectors have a fixed order.

#### Data Frames

`R` data frames are like an `SQL` table: 
- Multiple vectors (columns)
- Same length
- Identified by name

The `PlantGrowth` data frame comes built into `R`. 
```{r ex_df1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
PlantGrowth
```

This is a two column data frame with a numeric column (`weight`) and a string column
(`group`).

We're going to hold off on working with data frames until later in this tutorial.

#### Lists

A `list` is like a vector but the elements can be of any type, even including other lists.
```{r ex_list, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- list("a", 3, PlantGrowth)
y <- list("a", 3, x)
print(y)
```
We won't use lists much, but under the hood most everything (even a data frame) is just
a fancy list.

### Functions

In many of these exercises, we have used commands that have the form 
`NAME()`
with zero or more comma-separated elements in the parentheses. 

This represents a _function_ call. Specifically, the command
`func(x, y)` calls the function named `func` with two _arguments_ `x` and `y`.

Functions are the _verbs_ of the programming world. They are how anything gets done.
So far, we've only used some basic functions: 

- `c`: the concatenate function
- `print`: the print function
- `str`: the structure function
- `list`: the list making function

But there are tons of other useful ones!

Try these out: 
- `length` on a vector
- `colnames` on a data frame (like `PlantGrowth`)
- `toupper` on a string (vector)
- `as.character` on a numeric value

```{r ex_fun, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
length(x)
colnames(PlantGrowth)
y <- c("Baruch", "CUNY", "Zicklin")
toupper(y)
as.character(cos(pi))
```

#### Arguments: Positional and Keyword

The _inputs_ to a function are called the arguments. They come in two forms: 
- Positional
- Keyword

So far we have only seen positional arguments. The function interprets them in an 
order that depends on they were given: 
```{r ex_fun2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 3
y <- 5
paste(x, y)
paste(y, x)
```
Here `paste` combines two values into a string. We get different output strings
depending on the order of the input.

Other arguments can be passed as _keyword_ arguments. Keyword arguments come with
names that tell functions how to interpret them. For example, the `paste` function
has an optional keyword argument `sep` that controls how the strings are combined. 
```{r ex_fun3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 3
y <- 5
paste(x, y, sep="+")
paste(y, x, sep="><><")
```
Keyword arguments typically have defaults so you don't need to always provide them.
For the `paste` function, the `sep` defaults to `" "`.

### Creating Your Own Functions

When you want to 


You can see the code used to define a function by 
printing it: think of the code as being the "value" and the function 
name as the variable name. (This isn't actually a metaphor - it's true!)


## SQL-Like Data Manipulations in `R`

In this section, you will learn how to:

* use `filter()` to extract observations from a data frame or tibble
* write logical tests in R
* combine logical tests with Boolean operators
* handle missing values within logical tests

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2.

To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the `nycflights13` package. This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is documented in `?flights`. This is the same dataset we used in the first lecture, but now in `R` instead of `sqlite`.

To load it, we will use the `library(nycflights13)` command. Don't try to parse the BTS website
unless you like living dangerously.

### Filter rows with `filter()`

#### filter()

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st. Click Run Code to give it a try:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
library(nycflights13) # Load the flights data
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

The `filter` function is similar to the `WHERE` clause in SQL. As we will later see, 
it can also be used to implement the `HAVING` clause.

####  output

Like all dplyr functions, `filter()` returns a new data frame for you to save or use. It doesn't overwrite the old data frame.

If you want to save the output of `filter()`, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`.

Rerun the command in the code chunk below, but first arrange to save the output to an object named `jan1`.

```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r filter2-solution}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

####

Good job! You can now see the results by running the name jan1 by itself. Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input.

Did you notice that this code used the double equal operator, `==`? `==` is one of R's logical comparison operators. Comparison operators are key to using `filter()`, so let's take a look at them.

### Logical Comparisons

#### Comparison operators

R provides a suite of comparison operators that you can use to compare values: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). Each creates a logical test. For example, is `pi` greater than three?

```{r}
pi > 3
```

####

When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ whose day value was equal to one.

#### Watch out!

When you start out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

### Multiple tests

If you give `filter()` more than one logical test, `filter()` will combine the tests with an implied "and." In other words, `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every test. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators...

### Boolean operators

#### &, |, and !

R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (_and_), `|` (_or_), `!` (_not_ or _negation_), and `xor()` (_exactly or_).

Both `|` and `xor()` will return TRUE if one or the other logical comparison returns TRUE. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return FALSE if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exactly or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each command selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write out a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

###

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
    filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
    ```

###

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values should evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
NA == NA
```

In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`.

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r}
NA == NA
```

It's easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

### filter() and NAs

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that

1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex1-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120) # arr_delay is in minutes
    ```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

    ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex2-solution}
    filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```

    <div id="filterex2-hint">
    **Hint:** This is a good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)

    ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex3-solution}
    filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
    ```

    <div id="filterex3-hint">
    **Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>

1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

    ```{r filterex4, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex4-solution}
    filter(flights, 6 < month, month < 10)
    ```

    <div id="filterex4-hint">
    **Hint:** When converted to numbers, July, August, and September become 7, 8, and 9.
    </div>

1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

    ```{r filterex5, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex5-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
    ```

    <div id="filterex5-hint">
    **Hint:** Remember that departure and arrival delays are recorded in     _minutes_.
    </div>

1. Were delayed more than an hour, but made up more than 30 minutes in flight

    ```{r filterex6, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex6-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_delay > 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay) > 30)
    ```

    <div id="filterex6-hint">
    **Hint:** The time a plane makes up is `dep_delay - arr_delay`.
    </div>

1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

    ```{r filterex7, exercise = TRUE}

    ```
    ```{r filterex7-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400)
    ```

    <div id="filterex7-hint">
    **Hint:** Don't forget flights that left at exactly midnight (`2400`). This is a good case for an "or" operator.
    </div>

### Exercise 2

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use `between()` to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r filterex8, exercise = TRUE}
?between
```

### Exercise 3

How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r filterex9, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r filterex9-solution}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

<div id="filterex9-hint">
**Hint:** This is a good case for `is.na()`.
</div>

Flights with a missing departure time are probably cancelled flights.

### Exercise 4

Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing?
Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general
rule?  (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)

```{r filterex10, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r filterex10-hint-1}
# any number with a zero exponent is equal to one
NA ^ 0
```

```{r filterex10-hint-2}
# unknown value or true evaluates to true
# (because if one operand of "or" is true, we can be sure the result is true)
NA | TRUE
```

```{r filterex10-hint-3}
# false and unknown value evaluates to false
# (because if one operand of "and" is true, we can be sure the result is false)
FALSE & NA
```

```{r filterex10-hint-4}
# this is not a logical comparison, it's a numerical calculation involving an
# unknown value, thus resulting in an unknown value
NA * 0
```
